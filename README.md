# ATM Simulator
# A Vhdl code for atm simulation

Design, implement, verify, and test an Automated Teller Machine based on the following
specification:
The teller machine should provide the following services to the user (operator):
• Balance Inquiry (BAL)
• Cash Withdrawal (COUT)
• Deposit Cash (CIN)
• Deposit a Check (CHEC)
• Change PIN (CPIN)


# Setup

## Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://git
```

## Usage 
Instructions on how to run the code, experiments, and reproduce results.
```
python -m scripts.test_pybullet_MPPI
```
Once everything successfully installed, you'll see the simulated robot following a helical trajectory within the PyBullet simulator.




and for the MLP forward kinematics model, you can run the following command:
```
python -m scripts.test_Full_FK

```
